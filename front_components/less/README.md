# LESS CSS

Make sure to use this folder for your client-side stylesheet needs!

Currently, all client-side CSS that isn't from a vendor is taken from this folder.

If you would like to use typical CSS instead of  LESS, you can remove this and the function to compile LESS in the gulpfile. Make sure you replace it with the vendor-equivalent function to compile your own client-side code.
