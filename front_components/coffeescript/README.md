# Coffeescript

Make sure to use this folder for your client-side scripting needs!

Currently, all client-side code that isn't from a vendor is taken from this folder.

If you would like to use Javascript instead of Coffeescript, you can remove this and the function to compile Coffeescript in the gulpfile. Make sure you replace it with the vendor-equivalent function to compile your own client-side code.
